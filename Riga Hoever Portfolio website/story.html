            <P>I have always had a creative mindset. In school I was distracted most of the
                time because of my imagination. Lost in my imaginary world,
                drawing whenever I got the chance. <br>My father presented me and
                my siblings a Commodore 64 and Amiga  and other old skool consoles 
                for playing games.<br> Yes. I am a Millennial and proud of it! </P> <br>

        <div class="container-story-1 base-background container-fluid">
            <P>I decided to go to a design academy.  Grafisch Lyceum in Amsterdam. Now goes by the name MA
                College.
                I passed the exam back in 2004 for the course Multimedia Designer. </P>
            <P>Not finding any interesting courses to follow after graduation, I started applying for work.
                Just one problem. Even Though I got design experience through internships, that didn’t include
                programming. So in the end not a single employer would look my way with only experience as an
                intern. <b>"Houston, we have a problem!</b>
                <center> <img src="img/avatar4.png" class="img-fluid border" alt="Responsive image"></center>
            </P>
             
             
            <P>After working in retail for years, I never stopped designing. And stayed active with creating
                personal 2D concepts like characters, apps, logos and more. By the way if you
                want to see some examples of my work, check out my <a href="gallery.html"> gallery here!</P></a>

        <div class="container-story-1 base-background container-fluid">
            <P>I looked around for traineeships. I found tons. Because I figured, if I learn how to program I
                can brind my personal
                projects to life, plus find myself a fun job in the future. Sounds like a good plan to me!
                Unfortunately, in a lot of cases when it comes to coding traineeships
                you need to have at least a HBO Bachelor or HBO diploma to be able to compete. And I had
                neither. Also had neither the time nor money to enter a 4 year university.
                That’s when I found out about Techgrounds. </P>
             
            <P>Techgrounds gave me the opportunity to learn how to code. And I couldn’t be more happy about it.
                Ever since I started, I felt like a little kid walking into the candy store. This changed my
                life big time and am very gratefull for this opportunity. </P>
